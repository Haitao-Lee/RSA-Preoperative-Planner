# RSAPlanner: an efficient preoperative planning software for Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty

![Fig.1 The overview of our pipeline comprises three stages: (a) automatic zygomatic bone positioning through shape-prior-knowledge-based multi-planar cutting. (b) Generation of partitioned alternative trajectories guided by extracting dense 'backlit' points. (c) Utilization of a BIC-maximized algorithm to determine the optimal implanted paths.](https://github.com/Haitao-Lee/RSA-Preoperative-Planner/blob/main/fig/UI.png)
